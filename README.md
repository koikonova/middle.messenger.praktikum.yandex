## Description
Development of a complete SPA: a web messenger using only JavaScript and TypeScript.
The idea of this application was to avoid using frameworks and libraries on the client side to understand their underlying mechanics.
During the project, some functionalities from libraries like React and React Router were implemented.
The project includes standard chat functions: registration, authorization, chat list, and messaging.
